## ‚ö° Deployment (GitHub Actions)

This project is ready for automatic deployment using GitHub Actions.

1. **Push to `main` branch**: The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` will build and deploy your app.
2. **Configure repository secrets**: Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions, and add all variables from `.env.production` as repository secrets.
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: In your repo settings, set Pages source to "GitHub Actions".
4. **Access your site**: After a successful workflow run, your app will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.

_You can also deploy to Netlify or Vercel by adding the appropriate secrets._
